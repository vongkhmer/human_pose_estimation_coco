# human_pose_estimation_coco
This an implementation of a simple human pose's estimation model that is trained on MS COCO dataset.
The architecture of this model is based on a paper by Bin Xiao et al.

I implement this model using Pytorch and train in on MS COCO dataset.
This implementation is a replicating experiment and for my learning purpose.
